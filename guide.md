# Instructor guide

### How to start

<Here can be a starting anecdote or a starting question.>


### Questions to involve participants

<Here list a couple of questions that can be asked to
wake participants up.>


### Timing

<Give hints on timing.>

- The first episode is densest and introduces many new concepts, 
  so at least an hour is required for it. 
- The forking-workflow exercise (episode 3) repeats familiar concepts (only 
  introduces forking and distributed workflows), and it takes maybe half the 
  time of the first episode.
- The "How to contribute changes to somebody else's project" episode can be 
  covered really quickly
  

### Core aspects

<Main points we need to give across. List also goals for the lesson.>


### Sessions which can be skipped if time is tight

<List optional sessions here.>

- The bare vs non-bare episode can be skipped over without any harm done
- The hooks episode is typically skipped

### Typical pitfalls

<Document here with what participants often struggle.>

- The difference between pull and pull requests can be confusing, explain clearly that 
  pull requests are a different mechanism specific to GitHub, GitLab...
- The behavior that additional commits to a branch from which a pull request has been created get appended
  to the pull request needs to be explained
