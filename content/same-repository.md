## Exercise

:::{exercise} Exercise: Collaborating within the same repository (25 min)

**What is familiar** from the previous workshop days:
- Creating a branch.
- Committing a change on the new branch.
- Submit a pull request towards the main branch.

**What will be new** in this exercise:
- If you create the changes locally, you will need to **push** them to the remote repository.
- Learning what a protected branch is and how to modify a protected branch: using a pull request.
- Cross-referencing issues and pull requests.
- Practice to review a pull request.
- Learn about the value of draft pull requests.

**Exercise tasks**:
1. Open an issue where you describe the change you want to make.
1. Create a new branch.
1. Make a change to the recipe book on the new branch and in the commit cross-reference the issue you opened.
1. Open a pull request towards the main branch.
1. Review somebody else's pull request and give constructive feedback.
1. Try to create a new branch with some half-finished work and open a draft
   pull request. Verify that the draft pull request cannot be merged since it
   is not meant to be merged yet.
