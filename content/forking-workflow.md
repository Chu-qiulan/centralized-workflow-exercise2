# How to contribute changes to repositories that belong to others


We will add more details and screenshots before the course.


## Exercise

:::{exercise} Exercise: Collaborating within the same repository (25 min)

**What is familiar** from the previous workshop days:
- Forking a repository.
- Creating a branch.
- Committing a change on the new branch.
- Opening and merging pull requests.

**What will be new** in this exercise:
- Opening a pull request towards the upstream repository.
- Learning that your fork can get out of date.
- After the pull requests are merged, updating your fork with the changes.
- Learn how to approach other people's repositories with ideas, changes, and requests.

**Exercise tasks**:
1. Open an issue in the upstream exercise repository where you describe the
   change you want to make. Take note of the issue number.
1. Create a new branch in your fork of the repository.
1. Make a change to the recipe book on the new branch and in the commit cross-reference the issue you opened.
   See the walk-through below for how to do this.
1. Open a pull request towards the upstream repository.
1. After few pull requests are merged, update your fork with the changes.
1. Check that in your fork you can see changes from other people's pull requests.
