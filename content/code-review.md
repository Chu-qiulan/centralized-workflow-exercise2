We will add more details and screenshots before the course.


## Exercise

:::{exercise} Exercise: Practicing code review (25 min)

**What is familiar** from the previous workshop days:
- Creating a branch.
- Committing a change on the new branch.
- Opening and merging pull requests.

**What will be new** in this exercise:
- As a reviewer, we will learn how to ask for changes in a pull request.
- As a reviewer, we will learn how to suggest a change in a pull request.
- As a submitter, we will learn how to modify a pull request without closing
  the incomplete one and opening a new one.

**Exercise tasks**:
1. Create a new branch and one or few commits: in these improve something but also
   deliberately introduce a typo and also a larger mistake which we will want to fix during the code review.
1. Open a pull request towards the main branch.
1. As a reviewer to somebody else's pull request, ask for an improvement and
   also directly suggest a change for the small typo.
1. As the submitter, learn how to accept the suggested change.
1. As the submitter, improve the pull request without having to close and open
   a new one: by adding a new commit to the same branch.
1. Once the changes are addressed, merge the pull request.
